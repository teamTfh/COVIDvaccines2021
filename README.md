Since early 2020, COVID-19 vaccines have been eagerly anticipated worldwide as a tool to help to end the pandemic. Indeed, COVID-19 vaccination programs aim to vaccinate the nearly 8 billion people on earth, yet we understand little about immunity generated by COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we compared T and B cell responses longitudinally in individuals who were either SARS-CoV-2-naive or SARS-CoV-2-experienced and were due to receive the BNT162b2 vaccination series. We identified several major observations. First, we demonstrated induction of CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses to vaccination using unbiased cluster analysis of 35-parameter spectral flow cytometry data. We identified a progressive induction of antigen-specific B cell responses in circulation following each vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-naive adults, whereas SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults had robust induction of antigen-specific B cell responses after the first vaccination but only muted responses to the second vaccination. Next, we found that SARS-CoV-2-naive adults had progressively higher anti-S1 IgG antibody responses longitudinally whereas SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults demonstrated robust anti-S1 IgG antibody responses after the first immunization but little increase after the second immunization. These data underscore the importance of understanding the influence of prior immune history on subsequent vaccination and have major implications for personalization of COVID-19 vaccine regimens and booster shots.
